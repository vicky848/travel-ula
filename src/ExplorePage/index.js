    <p className ="card-text">In Southern Kenya, Amboseli National Park sits on the Tanzania border with incredible views of Mount Kilimanjaro. As the snow melts off the towering peak, water streams down and collects at the base, leaving a great source of water and greenery for loads of elephants. The Amboseli Trust for Elephants also resides here, fueling impressive research and conservation projects that aim to ensure elephant safety in the region and throughout Africa.

June through October are the best months to visit Amboseli for seeing elephants because the dry season forces wildlife to congregate near the larger remaining water sources. January and February, with little rainfall during those months, 
are also great times to visit Amboseli.</p>

The vantage point offers sweeping views of the savannah, woodlands, and riverine landscapes, making it an excellent spot to relax and take in the natural beauty of Nairobi National Park.

Leopard Sightings: The area around Leopard Cliff is known for its occasional leopard sightings. These shy, elusive cats tend to hide in the rocky outcrops and trees surrounding the cliff, so visitors are encouraged to bring binoculars and remain patient for potential sightings.
